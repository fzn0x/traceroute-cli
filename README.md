# Traceroute CLI

Originally from [node-traceroute](https://github.com/jaw187/node-traceroute), but since it's unmaintained, I try to rewrite the entire process into CLI application.

## Features

✅ Aims to be cross-platform tracerouter CLI, using cross-spawn in charge\
❌ Save traceroute log to file (TODO)

## Usage

```sh
npm i -g traceroute-cli
```

then trace the route which are desired

```
traceroute-cli google.com
```
